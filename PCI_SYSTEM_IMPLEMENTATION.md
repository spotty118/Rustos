# PCI Bus Enumeration and Management System for RustOS

## Overview

A comprehensive PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) bus enumeration and management system has been successfully implemented for RustOS. This system provides complete hardware discovery, device identification, configuration management, and resource allocation capabilities following PCI specification standards.

## Architecture

The PCI system is organized into four main components:

### 1. PCI Bus Scanner (`src/pci/mod.rs`)
**Functionality:**
- Real PCI configuration space access via I/O ports 0xCF8 (address) and 0xCFC (data)
- Complete bus/device/function enumeration (0-255 buses, 32 devices per bus, 8 functions per device)
- Device identification including Vendor ID, Device ID, Class, Subclass, and Revision
- Capability detection and parsing (MSI, MSI-X, Power Management, PCI Express)
- Support for both single and multifunction devices

**Key Features:**
- `PciDevice` struct containing complete device information
- `PciClass` enum with 20+ device classes (Network, Storage, Display, etc.)
- `PciCapabilities` struct tracking advanced device features
- Thread-safe global PCI scanner with lazy initialization
- Configuration space read/write operations (8, 16, and 32-bit)

### 2. Device Database (`src/pci/database.rs`)
**Comprehensive Vendor Support:**
- 30+ major vendors (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, Broadcom, Realtek, Qualcomm, etc.)
- 200+ known device IDs with detailed descriptions
- Virtual machine device support (VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V, VirtIO)

**Device Categories:**
- Network controllers (Ethernet, Wireless)
- Storage controllers (SATA, IDE, NVMe)
- Graphics cards (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA)
- Audio devices and multimedia controllers
- USB and other serial bus controllers
- Bridge devices and system peripherals

**Database Functions:**
- Vendor name and description lookup
- Device identification and categorization
- Driver recommendation based on device type
- Statistical reporting capabilities

### 3. PCI Configuration Management (`src/pci/config.rs`)
**Configuration Space Operations:**
- Base Address Register (BAR) management with size detection
- Support for 32-bit and 64-bit memory BARs and I/O BARs
- Command register control (I/O space, memory space, bus mastering)
- Status register monitoring
- Interrupt line configuration

**Advanced Features:**
- MSI (Message Signaled Interrupt) configuration and control
- MSI-X capability management
- Power management state control (D0-D3)
- Capability structure parsing and navigation
- Resource allocation and mapping preparation

**BAR Management:**
- Automatic BAR size detection through write-read testing
- Support for prefetchable memory regions
- 64-bit address handling for modern devices
- Resource conflict detection preparation

### 4. Hardware Detection System (`src/pci/detection.rs`)
**Automatic Discovery:**
- Complete system hardware enumeration on boot
- Device categorization by function and vendor
- Resource conflict detection (memory, I/O, interrupt)
- Hot-plug capability identification

**Conflict Detection:**
- Memory address space overlap detection
- I/O port range conflict identification
- Interrupt sharing analysis with severity assessment
- Critical device identification for system stability

**Driver Matching:**
- Automatic driver recommendation based on device type
- Vendor-specific driver suggestions (e1000, r8169, i915, etc.)
- Device category classification (Network, Storage, Graphics, etc.)
- Power management capability assessment

## Integration

### Boot Sequence Integration
The PCI system is integrated into the main kernel boot sequence in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn init_kernel() {
    // ... other initializations ...

    // Initialize PCI bus enumeration
    init_pci_system();
    println!("✓ PCI bus enumeration completed");

    // Initialize drivers (can now use PCI information)
    init_drivers_main();
    println!("✓ Device drivers initialized");
}
```

### Library Export
All PCI functionality is exported through `src/lib.rs`:
```rust
// PCI bus enumeration and management
pub mod pci;
```

## API Usage Examples

### Basic Device Enumeration
```rust
// Initialize PCI system
rustos::pci::init_pci()?;

// Get all devices
let devices = rustos::pci::get_all_devices();

// Print device information
rustos::pci::print_devices();
```

### Device-Specific Operations
```rust
// Find a specific device
let scanner = rustos::pci::get_pci_scanner().lock();
if let Some(device) = scanner.find_device(0x8086, 0x100E) { // Intel 82540EM
    let config_manager = PciConfigManager::new(&scanner);

    // Enable bus mastering
    config_manager.set_bus_master_enable(&device, true)?;

    // Read BARs
    let bars = config_manager.read_bars(&device);

    // Configure MSI if supported
    if device.capabilities.msi {
        config_manager.enable_msi(&device, msi_address, msi_data)?;
    }
}
```

### Hardware Detection
```rust
// Perform comprehensive hardware detection
let results = rustos::pci::detection::detect_and_report_hardware()?;

// Get specific device categories
let network_cards = rustos::pci::detection::get_devices_by_category(
    DeviceCategory::NetworkCard
);
```
