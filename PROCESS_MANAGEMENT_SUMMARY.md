# RustOS Comprehensive Process Management System

## Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of the comprehensive process management system implemented for RustOS. The system includes all major components of a modern operating system's process management subsystem with proper integration into the existing kernel architecture.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Process Control Block (PCB) Structure (`src/process/mod.rs`)

**Key Features:**
- Complete process information storage including PID, parent PID, state, priority
- CPU context for register saving/restoring during context switches
- Memory management information (page directory, virtual memory layout)
- File descriptor table with support for standard I/O
- Scheduling information (time slices, CPU affinity, statistics)
- Support for process creation time tracking and exit status

**Process States:**
- Ready: Process is ready to run
- Running: Process is currently executing
- Blocked: Process is waiting for I/O or resources
- Zombie: Process has terminated but PCB still exists
- Dead: Process has been completely cleaned up

**Priority Levels:**
- RealTime (highest priority)
- High
- Normal (default)
- Low
- Idle (lowest priority)

### 2. Task Scheduler (`src/process/scheduler.rs`)

**Scheduling Algorithms:**
- **Round-Robin Scheduling**: Time-sliced scheduling with fair CPU distribution
- **Priority-Based Scheduling**: Higher priority processes run first
- **Multilevel Feedback Queue**: Combines priority and round-robin with aging

**Key Features:**
- Multiple priority queues with different time slices
- Process aging to prevent starvation
- Context switch counting and performance metrics
- CPU utilization tracking
- Preemptive scheduling with timer interrupts
- Process blocking and unblocking support

**Statistics Tracking:**
- Total context switches
- Scheduling decisions count
- Average wait time calculation
- CPU utilization percentage
- Per-process scheduling statistics

### 3. System Calls Interface (`src/process/syscalls.rs`)

**System Call Categories:**

**Process Management:**
- `exit`: Terminate calling process
- `fork`: Create new process (child)
- `exec`: Execute new program
- `wait`: Wait for child process termination

- `setpriority`/`getpriority`: Process priority control

**Error Handling:**
- Comprehensive error codes for different failure scenarios
- Proper return value handling for success/failure cases

### 4. Context Switching (`src/process/context.rs`)

- Kernel stack management per process
- User space separation and protection

**Assembly Integration:**
- Low-level assembly functions for maximum efficiency
- Naked functions for direct register manipulation
- Architecture-specific optimizations

### 5. Process Synchronization (`src/process/sync.rs`)

**Synchronization Primitives:**

**Mutexes:**
- Recursive mutex support
- Priority inheritance to prevent priority inversion
- Owner tracking and validation

**Semaphores:**

## Enhanced Integration with Existing RustOS

### Main Kernel Integration (`src/main.rs`)

The existing process management in `main.rs` has been enhanced to:

1. **Initialize the comprehensive system**: Falls back gracefully to simple system if initialization fails
2. **Display detailed process information**: Shows process details, states, and priorities
3. **Demonstrate synchronization features**: Creates and shows various sync primitives
4. **Provide compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

### Library Integration (`src/lib.rs`)

- Added process module to the main library exports
- Maintains existing functionality while adding new capabilities
- Proper error handling and resource management

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Thread Safety
- All major data structures use appropriate synchronization primitives (Mutex, RwLock, AtomicU32)
- Lock-free algorithms where possible for performance
- Careful lock ordering to prevent deadlocks

### Memory Management
- Integration with existing memory allocator
- Proper cleanup on process termination
- Virtual memory isolation between processes

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy FPU context switching to reduce overhead
- Priority queues for efficient scheduling
- Atomic operations for lock-free paths
- Minimal critical sections

### Scalability
- Configurable limits (MAX_PROCESSES = 1024)
- Efficient data structures (BTreeMap for O(log n) operations)
- Modular design for easy extension

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Process
```rust
let process_manager = process::get_process_manager();
let pid = process_manager.create_process("my_app", Some(parent_pid), Priority::Normal)?;
```

### Using Synchronization
```rust
let sync_manager = process::sync::get_sync_manager();
let mutex_id = sync_manager.create_mutex();
sync_manager.acquire(mutex_id, current_pid)?;
// Critical section
sync_manager.release(mutex_id, current_pid)?;
```

### System Calls
```rust
// From user space (conceptually)
let result = syscall(SyscallNumber::GetPid as u64, &[])?;
let pid = result as u32;
```
