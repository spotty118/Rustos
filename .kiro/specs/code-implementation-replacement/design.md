# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines a systematic approach to replace placeholder code, simulation code, and mock implementations throughout the RustOS kernel with production-ready, fully functional implementations. The effort involves identifying and categorizing placeholder code, then implementing real hardware interactions, system calls, memory management, and other kernel subsystems.

Based on code analysis, the major areas requiring real implementations include:
- System call implementations with proper user-space memory handling
- Hardware abstraction layer with real device communication
- Process management with actual context switching and scheduling
- Memory management with real page table operations
- Network stack with actual packet processing
- Time management with real hardware timer integration
- Security and validation with proper privilege checking
- Graphics and GPU operations with hardware acceleration
- Storage systems with real device I/O operations
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Architecture

### Code Classification System

The replacement effort will categorize existing code into four types:

1. **Placeholder Code**: Functions that return mock values or perform no operations
2. **Simulation Code**: Code that mimics hardware behavior without actual hardware interaction
3. **Incomplete Implementations**: Partially implemented features missing critical functionality
4. **Debug/Testing Code**: Development-only code that needs production equivalents

### Implementation Strategy

The design follows a layered approach, implementing foundational systems first with emphasis on performance optimization and proper hardware abstraction:

```
Layer 4: Applications & Services
├── System calls with real user-space interaction and zero-copy optimizations
├── Process management with actual scheduling and SMP load balancing
└── File system with real storage operations and intelligent caching

Layer 3: Kernel Services
├── Memory management with real page tables and architecture-specific optimizations
├── Security validation with privilege checking and hardware-assisted features
└── IPC with actual inter-process communication and shared memory optimization

Layer 2: Hardware Abstraction
├── Device drivers with real hardware communication and standardized interfaces
├── Interrupt handling with actual hardware interrupts and minimal latency
└── Timer management with real hardware timers and high-resolution support

Layer 1: Core Foundation
├── Boot sequence with real hardware initialization and graceful fallbacks
├── Memory layout with actual physical memory mapping and zone management
└── Basic I/O with real hardware ports and efficient access patterns
```

**Design Rationale**: This layered approach ensures that each implementation builds upon stable, tested foundations while maintaining clear separation of concerns. The emphasis on performance optimization at each layer addresses Requirement 4's need for efficient hardware utilization, while the standardized interfaces support Requirement 5's maintainability goals.
