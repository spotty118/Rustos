# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on systematically replacing placeholder code, simulation code, and mock implementations throughout the RustOS kernel with production-ready, fully functional implementations. The goal is to transform the current codebase from a prototype/development state into a production-ready operating system kernel with real hardware interaction and complete functionality.

The scope includes replacing mock system calls, placeholder hardware interactions, simulated device responses, and incomplete implementations across all kernel subsystems including memory management, process scheduling, network stack, storage systems, and graphics operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a kernel developer, I want all placeholder implementations replaced with real code, so that the kernel can perform actual hardware operations and system functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the kernel boots THEN the system SHALL use real hardware access instead of placeholder code
2. WHEN system calls are invoked THEN the system SHALL perform actual operations instead of returning mock responses
3. WHEN device drivers are loaded THEN the system SHALL communicate with real hardware instead of simulated responses
4. WHEN memory management functions are called THEN the system SHALL perform actual memory allocation and deallocation
5. WHEN network operations are requested THEN the system SHALL use real network hardware and protocols

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the kernel to interact with real hardware components, so that the operating system can manage actual system resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PCI devices are enumerated THEN the system SHALL read actual PCI configuration space data
2. WHEN ACPI tables are parsed THEN the system SHALL access real ACPI data from firmware
3. WHEN interrupts are handled THEN the system SHALL process actual hardware interrupts
4. WHEN GPU operations are performed THEN the system SHALL communicate with real graphics hardware
5. WHEN storage operations occur THEN the system SHALL access actual storage devices

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a kernel developer, I want comprehensive error handling for real hardware interactions, so that the system can gracefully handle hardware failures and edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hardware initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and logging
2. WHEN device communication errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry mechanisms
3. WHEN resource allocation fails THEN the system SHALL handle graceful degradation
4. WHEN hardware is not present THEN the system SHALL continue operation with reduced functionality
5. WHEN invalid hardware responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want optimized real implementations, so that the kernel performs efficiently with actual hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory operations are performed THEN the system SHALL optimize them for the target hardware architecture
2. WHEN I/O operations occur THEN the system SHALL use efficient hardware access patterns
3. WHEN interrupt handling is active THEN the system SHALL minimize latency and overhead
4. WHEN network packets are processed THEN the system SHALL use zero-copy techniques where possible
5. WHEN graphics operations are performed THEN the system SHALL leverage hardware acceleration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a kernel maintainer, I want proper hardware abstraction layers, so that the real implementations remain maintainable and portable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hardware-specific code is implemented THEN the system SHALL properly abstract it behind generic interfaces
2. WHEN new hardware support is added THEN the system SHALL follow established patterns and interfaces
3. WHEN platform-specific code is written THEN the system SHALL clearly separate it from generic code
4. WHEN hardware drivers are implemented THEN the system SHALL use consistent error handling patterns
5. WHEN hardware resources are managed THEN the system SHALL use standardized resource management APIs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing of real implementations, so that the kernel is reliable and stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real hardware code is implemented THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for testable components
2. WHEN hardware interactions are coded THEN the system SHALL include integration tests where possible
3. WHEN error conditions are handled THEN the system SHALL test them with appropriate test scenarios
4. WHEN performance-critical code is implemented THEN the system SHALL include performance benchmarks
5. WHEN hardware compatibility is implemented THEN the system SHALL test it across different hardware configurations
