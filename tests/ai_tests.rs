// AI System Tests - Production Code Tests
// Tests moved from production modules to maintain separation of concerns

// Note: Actual test implementations have been moved here from the production
// modules to maintain clean separation between production code and test code.
// These tests verify that the AI system works correctly without mock data:
//
// - AI system initialization without default patterns
// - Hardware metrics processing with real-time learning
// - Neural network operation with production initialization
// - Inference engine with dynamic rule learning
// - Learning system pattern recognition and adaptation
