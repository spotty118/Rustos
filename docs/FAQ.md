# RustOS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is RustOS?

RustOS is an **independent operating system kernel** written in Rust from the ground up. It is not a Linux distribution, nor is it based on the Linux kernel. RustOS is a separate kernel project that aims to provide modern OS capabilities with the safety and performance benefits of the Rust programming language.

### Is RustOS based on Linux?

**No.** RustOS is a completely independent kernel written from scratch in Rust. While it shares some architectural concepts with modern operating systems (including Linux), it has its own codebase, design philosophy, and implementation.

### Can RustOS be merged into the Linux kernel?

**No, and this is not a goal or possibility for several fundamental reasons:**

1. **Completely Different Codebases**: RustOS is written entirely in Rust (with minimal assembly), while the Linux kernel is written in C. These are fundamentally incompatible codebases that cannot be simply "merged."

2. **Different Architecture**: RustOS has its own kernel architecture, memory management, process scheduling, and driver framework. It's not a subset or extension of Linux.

3. **Legal/Licensing Differences**: Linux is GPL-licensed, while RustOS is MIT-licensed. A merge would create complex licensing conflicts.

4. **Design Philosophy**: RustOS is designed around Rust's safety guarantees and modern kernel design principles, which differ from Linux's evolution over 30+ years.

5. **Technical Independence**: RustOS maintains its own boot process, hardware abstraction layer, system call interface, and driver model.

**The question is similar to asking "Can FreeBSD be merged into Linux?" - they are separate operating systems that serve different purposes.**

## Linux Compatibility

### Can RustOS run Linux software?

RustOS is working toward **binary compatibility** with Linux through several approaches, but it is **not a drop-in replacement for Linux**:

#### Current Compatibility Status:

1. **POSIX System Call Interface** ✅ In Progress
   - RustOS implements a POSIX-compatible system call interface
   - System calls are designed to match Linux syscall numbers and behavior
   - Located in `src/syscall/mod.rs` and `src/process/syscalls.rs`

2. **ELF Binary Loading** ✅ Implemented
   - RustOS can load and execute ELF64 binaries
   - Supports dynamic linking concepts (in progress)
   - Located in `src/process/elf_loader.rs`

3. **Process Management** ✅ Core Features Complete
   - Fork/exec model compatible with POSIX
   - Process lifecycle management
   - Scheduling similar to Linux CFS concepts

4. **File System Compatibility** 🚧 Partial
   - Virtual File System (VFS) with Linux-inspired design
   - Currently supports RamFS and DevFS
   - Future support planned for ext4, FAT32, and other Linux filesystems

5. **Network Stack** ✅ TCP/IP Compatible
   - Full TCP/IP stack compatible with standard protocols
   - Socket interface follows POSIX standards
   - Can communicate with Linux systems over the network

#### Limitations:

❌ **Cannot run Linux kernel modules** - These are kernel-space code specific to Linux  
❌ **No Linux-specific APIs** - SystemD, D-Bus, netlink sockets require additional work  
❌ **Limited driver compatibility** - Hardware drivers must be written for RustOS  
❌ **No Linux distribution packages** - Cannot install .deb or .rpm packages directly (see package manager integration below)  

### What about the Package Manager Integration?

The package manager integration documented in `docs/package_manager_integration.md` is **misleading in its current form**. Here's the reality:

- **Current State**: The document describes an aspirational system for interfacing with Linux package managers
- **Technical Reality**: RustOS cannot directly use Linux package managers (apt, dnf, etc.) because:
  - These tools expect the Linux kernel and its specific system calls
  - Binary packages are compiled for the Linux kernel's ABI
  - Dependencies assume Linux-specific libraries and frameworks

- **Realistic Approach**: For true package compatibility, RustOS would need:
  1. Complete Linux syscall compatibility layer
  2. Linux-compatible C library (glibc/musl equivalent)
  3. Binary compatibility at the ABI level
  4. Its own package management system or adaptation layer

### How does RustOS achieve Linux software compatibility?

RustOS achieves compatibility through **interface compatibility**, not code sharing:

1. **POSIX Compliance**: Implementing POSIX-standard system calls so programs expecting POSIX can run
2. **Binary Format**: Supporting ELF binaries like Linux does
3. **Standard Protocols**: Using standard network protocols, file formats, etc.
4. **API Compatibility**: Providing similar APIs where possible

**Example**: A simple C program that uses standard POSIX calls (open, read, write, fork, exec) could potentially run on both Linux and RustOS if compiled appropriately, because both systems implement those standard interfaces.

## Technical Architecture

### How is RustOS different from Linux?

| Aspect | Linux | RustOS |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Language** | C (with some Assembly) | Rust (with minimal Assembly) |
| **Age** | 30+ years (since 1991) | In active development |
| **Architecture** | Monolithic with modules | Monolithic with modern design |
| **Memory Safety** | Manual memory management | Rust's ownership system |
| **Driver Model** | Loadable kernel modules | Integrated driver framework |
| **License** | GPL v2 | MIT |
| **Maturity** | Production-ready, widespread | Experimental, educational |
| **Hardware Support** | Thousands of devices | Limited but growing |

### What are RustOS's goals compared to Linux?

**RustOS Goals:**
- Demonstrate modern kernel development in Rust
- Leverage Rust's safety guarantees for kernel code
- Provide a clean-slate implementation with modern design
- Educational and research platform
- Eventual production use in specific domains

**Not Goals:**
- Replace Linux in general-purpose computing
- Run all Linux software out-of-the-box
- Maintain bug-for-bug compatibility with Linux

### Can I run RustOS instead of Linux on my computer?

**Current Status**: RustOS is **not ready for production use** as a daily-driver operating system.

**What Works:**
- Boots on x86_64 hardware or in QEMU
- Basic desktop environment with GPU acceleration
- Network stack with TCP/IP
- Simple applications and demonstrations

**What Doesn't Work Yet:**
- Most hardware devices (limited driver support)
- Complex applications expecting full Linux compatibility
- User-space ecosystem (no shell, userland tools, etc.)
- Persistent storage and filesystems
- Security features for multi-user systems

**Recommendation**: RustOS is currently best suited for:
- Learning OS development
- Research projects
- Embedded systems (future)
- Experimentation and development

## Development and Contribution

### How can I contribute to Linux compatibility?

Contributions to improve Linux compatibility are welcome! Key areas:

1. **System Call Implementation**: Complete the POSIX syscall interface (`src/syscall/mod.rs`)
2. **ELF Loader**: Enhance dynamic linking support (`src/process/elf_loader.rs`)
3. **File System Support**: Implement ext4, FAT32 readers/writers
4. **C Library Port**: Port or create a musl-like C library for RustOS
5. **Driver Development**: Write drivers for common hardware
6. **Testing**: Test Linux binaries and document compatibility

### Is there a compatibility layer planned?

Yes, a **Linux compatibility layer** is on the roadmap:

**Phase 1** (Current): Core POSIX syscalls and ELF loading  
**Phase 2** (Planned): Extended syscall coverage, dynamic linking  
**Phase 3** (Future): Linux ABI compatibility layer for running Linux binaries  
**Phase 4** (Long-term): Container/namespace support similar to Docker  

### Can RustOS run in a container on Linux?

This is a different question! The answer is more nuanced:

- **RustOS as a kernel**: Cannot run in a standard container (containers share the host kernel)
- **RustOS in a VM**: Can run in QEMU, VirtualBox, or other hypervisors
- **Future possibility**: RustOS could potentially run Linux containers (implementing container runtime)

## Summary: The Bottom Line

**Question: "Can RustOS be merged into Linux for Linux software compatibility?"**

**Answer: No, but that's not the right approach.**

RustOS is a **separate operating system kernel**, not a Linux component. Merging it into Linux doesn't make technical or strategic sense. Instead, RustOS is pursuing **compatibility through standardized interfaces** (POSIX, ELF, etc.) so that well-written portable software can run on both systems.

Think of it this way:
- **macOS** isn't merged with Linux, but many programs run on both (because they use standard interfaces)
- **FreeBSD** isn't merged with Linux, but they can run similar software (POSIX compatibility)
- **RustOS** follows the same model: independent kernel, standard interfaces, growing compatibility

The path forward is **interface compatibility**, not code merging. RustOS implements standard interfaces that Linux software expects, allowing compatible programs to run without requiring the Linux kernel itself.
